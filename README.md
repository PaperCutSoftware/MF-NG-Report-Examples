# Examples SQL and other other data extraction tools

This repo contains

1. The SQL used to create the PaperCut MF/NG product reports
2. Other example scripts to help with data extraction


**Note**: Before investing in custom SQL extract scripts you should investigate if the following will help


1. CSV data extract using scheduled reports (see https://www.papercut.com/support/resources/manuals/ng-mf/applicationserver/topics/reports-scheduling.html)
2. CSV data extract using ad-hoc reports via the web services API (see https://github.com/PaperCutSoftware/PaperCutExamples/wiki/AdHoc-Reporting-API)
3. Custom reports (see https://www.papercut.com/support/resources/manuals/ng-mf/applicationserver/topics/reports-custom.html)
4. Health API (see https://www.papercut.com/support/resources/manuals/ng-mf/common/topics/tools-monitor-system-health-api.html)

In the future PaperCut MF/NG will have a new data extract function.
